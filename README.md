# WBGT

Here are some essential Python scripts used in the work
  "Escalating Global Exposure to Compound Heat-Humidity Extremes with Warming"
published on Environ. Res. Lett. in 2020 by Dawei Li, Jiacan Yuan and Robert Kopp
https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab7d04

Included scripts show how to calculate wet bulb temperature and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) using ERA5 reanalysis and CESM large ensemble output, how the bias of CESM is corrected, and how to calculate the exceedance frequency of daily maximum WBGT (WBGT_max) indexed by global mean surface air temperature.
